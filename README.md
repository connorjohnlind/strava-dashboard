# MERN Boilerplate Project

This is my ideal starting place for full-stack MERN projects. I will update this repo as I learn more about Webpack's ecosystem of plugins and features.

### Notable Features

* [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) - Reloading for stateful React Components
* [Webpack Hot Middleware](https://github.com/glenjamin/webpack-hot-middleware) - Using the backend as a hot-module-enabled development server
* [Vendor Code Splitting](https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-4-mode-and-optimization-5423a6bc597a) - Webpack 4's optimization options
* [Brotli and Gzip Compression](https://github.com/mynameiswhm/brotli-webpack-plugin) - Preparing compressed versions of assets
* [Sass, Autoprefixer, and CSS Nano with Extract Text](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin) - Pre/Post CSS Processing
